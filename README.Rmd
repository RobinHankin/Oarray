Package `Oarray` allows the user to define an arbitrary offset for
arrays.  By far the most common use-case is to specify zero offset in
each dimension, but the package is user-configurable.


## Installation

You can install the development version of Oarray from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("Oarray")
pak::pak("RobinHankin/Oarray")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library("Oarray")
A <- as.Oarray(array(1:24,2:4),offset=0)
A
A[0,0,0]
A[0, ,1] <- -99
A[ , ,1]
```
